### <a href="https://poddie62.github.io/RMIT/meandit">Tim</a> 

I was born and raised in Victoria. My parents are both Australian; however my grandparents were Czech refugees, who fled to Australia after world war two. I am agnostic, but was educated at a private catholic school in Melbourne, before briefly attending Deakin University. After deferring at the end of the second semester, I opted to work fulltime instead. I started working in Superannuation in late 2017, and have been there since. In May of 2019 I decided to advance my education by studying a Bachelor of Business online with RMIT, while still working. I enjoy reading, playing games on computers and playing tennis. While growing up, I had a pet Miniature pig that lived in the house with us. His name was Christopher.
