### <a href="https://poddie62.github.io/RMIT/meandit">Tim</a> 

I was born and grew up in Melbourne. My family lives across Melbourne and are mostly Australian. After finishing highschool I briefly attended Deakin University, studying a bachelor of arts. I deferred from the course after the second semester after realising I wanted to work fulltime rather than study. After working briefly in hospitality, I started working in finance for the National Australian Bank in 2017. Since then I have moved to a different company in a similar customer service role in Superannuation. Recently in May of 2019 I started studying a bachelor of business online with RMIT. When not working or studying, I enjoy playing tennis, reading, playing PC games and socialising. My main interest in IT stems from my childhood and job. Growing up I was always fascinated with how my family’s jobs were adapting based on the IT technology available. At work as well I rely strongly on a number of IT programs and platforms in order to deliver expected customer service and complex information to internal and external stakeholders. While I enjoy using these programs, I do not understand much beyond their surface level. I hope that this course will better educate me on how they function and how I can best use them going forward.

## IT Work

Interviewing: Technical Lead for large technology company focusing on creating online platforms for other companies. 

### 1.	Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?
The company I work for is the largest independently owned company in Australia for website and online development. We offer a range of services such as mobile apps, but our main focus is website design. 
My official role is Technical Lead, this means that I direct and manage a small team of people who work to launch and manage websites for large companies. As lead I have to manage and direct my team in their coding, while also overseeing their job performance and generally acting as a manager. 
Another large part of my job is working with other teams within the business such as design and development. Often my I have to use my experience in projects to make recommendations and decisions about what software to use. After choosing a strategy and software to run with, I have to develop a plan within our team about who will do what. After assigning work and delegating tasks, I oversee the development of the project within the team. 

### 2.	Please tell us about the industry you work in. 
The IT industry is very large, and depending on what area youre looking at it can range from very small independent companies to multinational giants. My company employs around 100 people, and our main competitor is Deloitte. Deloitte is obviously a very large company that specialises in many IT areas, whereas we focus primarily on website design. 
The industry overall is quite competitive as more and more companies seek to establish themselves online in different ways. Previously I have worked for a very small companies with around 10 -15 people in them, who essentially did the same job but for smaller projects. Because of the competitiveness though there is also a lot of opportunity to expand your skills and move into better roles.  


### 3.	What other kinds of work do you have to do? 
Apart from the management of my team, I also help spend a lot of time coding myself. Out of a 5 days working week, around 3-4 of those days I would spend writing or adapting code. 

I also deal directly with our design team and clients to help them formulate ideas around what is possible and what we can do for them. As I have experience within the industry, I can recommend certain ways to improve their plans or reach their goals in a realistic manner. 

While my job is mainly back end, as lead I also play a role in sales and presentations to clients. I look at the initial plans that they bring us, conduct a quote on how much this would be likely to cost and then work to plan out how we can achieve what they want. I am also present in sales meetings and client presentations, where my job mainly involves explaining in a technical perspective what we will, or have been doing. 


### 4.	Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.
On a weekly basis I interact with a range of internal and external stakeholders. As we have to work to our client’s specifications, very often we will be working onsite within their company for most of the week. So, often that means travelling to different locations to work all day in different environments. Even when on site, we have a daily online or physical meeting with all the leads and project coordinators each morning. In this we discuss any issues, progress reports and relevant updates on our projects. 
Client meetings also occur quite often as we coordinate with them to explain our progress and address any concerns they might have. Past clients that I have worked for include, Toyota, Carlton Football club and click frenzy. 

Internally I deal mainly with our design team and strategy and user experience team. My team works closely with them to make sure we are delivering on all of our goals in an effective way. 

### 5.	Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals? 
Within my organisation the main IT professionals I deal with on a day to day basis are the team that I manage and my own direct manager who coordinates projects. Within my team i take on a leadership role that includes reviewing and editing code made by them, as well as strategizing with them to work past obstacles. We also have monthly development and coaching sessions, in which i sit down individually with each member of the team and discuss their overall aims within the business and how i can help realise them going forward. As previously mentioned i talk to my direct manager at least once a day each morning meeting. I also often coordinate with him by phone or email each day about the particulars of each project. 

In a broader sense outside working hours, I normally interact with other IT workers at functions and events. It is quite common for a company to host an event with an open bar for people in certain IT fields. In this way, I often meet people in similar jobs to my own at separate companies. It is an excellent chance to socialise with people with similar skills and network. Plus it is a great way of staying up to date with any big events or technologies that have just been introduced within our field of expertise. 

### 6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?
My main interactions with clients can vary enormously depending on the need or desires of such client. My first interaction typically takes place via email or phone communication, in which i get a rough outline of what exactly a client is trying to achieve. After talking to other internal stakeholders about this, I work with the relevant other teams to estimate a quote for each client. If the client is interested further, they typically come in for a presentation on what exactly to expect while working with us. 
If the presentation is successful and the client is willing to go forward, I would then be working to realise the clients needs and goals in more details. Depending on the client, this might be done through a dedicated liaison i sit down and meet with, or internally through a client manager in my own company. Depending on the set up of each project, i would then work closely with a plan developed by the client to set up their website. 


### 7.      What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. 
As I mentioned earlier, most of my time is taken up by actual coding work. Depending on what was being developed, I would use a range of systems or tools, including Github to coordinate with members of my team in working on code. 
Aside from coding, the remainder of my time is split between managing my team’s time and efforts as well as coordinating with our client to make sure we are on the right track. 

### 8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? 
While coding is the most time consuming and arduous part of my job, the most difficult part would come down to communication. Often at the first stages of any project I will work with a designer or development professional whose job it is to explain how they want the website to look or function. As we will be the ones building the website, I have to push back and explain in a simple way why this is not always possible. Sometimes I would have to suggest other alternatives we could go with to achieve a similar result. While most clients wishes can usually be done, often seeing them built would result in a range of other problems to the website. Often we have to find a compromise on each plan before it is launched, and come up with a roadmap of how to achieve it. It can be quite challenging trying to explain to a client with limited IT knowledge as to why we cannot actualise some of their plan. 

### 9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?
The best example I can think of at the moment is our work on the Beyond Blue Facebook  chatbot that we recently created. It works in such a way that you a person can use it anytime and anywhere and be directed to the resources they need without a person being on the end answering their questions. It is programmed to recognise certain words and phrases and recommended them to certain helplines, websites or other areas depending on what they are looking for. 

It  was a very typical project that required us to work more closely than usual with the client involved. Due to the very serious nature of what topics we were dealing with and the expected user bases mindset we wanted to be sure the functionality of the chatbot was as close to perfect as we could make it. We also had to work within the existing Beyond Blue website that was currently operating, which meant coordinating with the existing company that hosted it. 

After a lot of edits and changes to the chatbot, we were finally able to complete it. It is now operating on the Beyond Blue facebook site. 

## IT Technologies

### Machine learning

Although most agree Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence, definitions and explanations of machine learning vary, including:

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. (Expert system 2019), and 

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. (SAS 2019)

But what does learn mean for computers, is it the same as learning for humans?  The Macquarie Dictionary defines learning as:
Learning is to acquire knowledge of or skill in by study, instruction or experience (Macquarie 2010)
Is this what it means for computers? How would we know when a computer has knowledge or a skill? Afterall, you can receive instruction without benefiting from it at all if it can’t be applied. It seems that learning in this context is more linked to performance and ability to apply learnings rather than building knowledge (Witten 2017).  
This learning occurs by using algorithms and statistical models  in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. (Wikipedia 2019) These algorithms build mathematical models using sample data, known as training data, and they are able to adapt without being specifically programmed to do the task (Wikipedia 2019). They learn from previous computations to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results. (SAS 2019)

This sample data needs to include robust, inclusive samples, otherwise outputs can contain bias that can lead to misleading information that may advantage or disadvantage. Datasets used to train AI systems must be appropriate for the system they are used to train (Dawson - CSIRO 2019). Data use must be ethical and useful and must not allow unfair bias, breaches to privacy or security and be of sufficient quality and relevance for input into algorithms (Dawson - CSIRO 2019). If the data that is input is not appropriate, then the outputs will not be reliable.

### The Machine Learning Process

The following are the steps common to most machine learning based projects:

Python tips, Introduction to Machine Learning and its Usage in Remote Sensing, https://pythontips.com/2017/11/11/introduction-to-machine-learning-and-its-usage-in-remote-sensing/ viewed 7 July 2019

As illustrated above, the first two steps are about gathering the data and cleansing it to ensure that it is complete, accurate, consistent and unique. This data is then used to build the model to select the right algorithm in the step 3, that will then be used in step 4 to gain insights which can be done in a number of ways. Two of the most widely adopted machine learning methods are supervised learning and unsupervised learning, but there are other types such as semi-supervised and reinforcement learning which I will also examine (SAS 2019).

<img src= "https://github.com/RobZyg/Assignment-2/blob/master/CML.jpg" > 
VAS3K, 2019, Machine Learning for everyone, https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/

Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labelled examples, such as an input where the desired output is known. (SAS 2019) As the example above illustrates using clothes. The clothes are sorted using a decision tree based on attributes known before ie socks labelled by colour - is it green or red, and ties by length – long or short. Often used for diagnostics, medicine and finance where historical data predicts future events (Vas3k 2019). Using methods like classification and regression, supervised learning uses patterns to predict the values of the label, that can then be used on additional unlabelled data, (SAS 2019) also known as data mining.

Unsupervised learning is used against data that has no historical labels (SAS 2019). Following on with the example above, the clothing is not labelled at all, so you’re dividing up socks when you don’t know what colours you have (VAS3K 2019). The goal is to explore the data and find some groupings or structure within it (SAS 2019). It works well for grouping data with similar attributes or identifying the main attributes that differentiate data, such as in marketing campaigns.

Semi-supervised learning is used for the same applications as supervised learning. But it uses both labelled and unlabelled data for training, typically a small amount of labelled data with a large amount of unlabelled data. This type of learning can be used with methods such as classification, regression and prediction. Semi-supervised learning is useful when the cost associated with labelling is too high to allow for a fully labelled training process. Early examples of this include identifying a person's face on a web cam (SAS 2019).

Reinforcement learning is not related to assessing a data set or sets, it is carried out by processing the deluge of data from an environment, like those encountered by autonomous cars (VAS3K 2019). Using reinforcement learning, the algorithm discovers through trial and error what actions produce the greatest rewards (SAS 2019).  The goal is to minimise the error rate, accidents or injuries in the autonomous car example, not predict everything (VAS3K 2019). This type of learning has three primary components, the agent (the learner or decision maker), the environment (everything the agent interacts with), and actions (what the agent can do). The objective is for the agent to choose actions that maximize the expected reward over a given amount of time (SAS 2019).
Machine learning over time

As you can see this has been around since the 1980s so what is behind the lastest surge in popularity? New computing technologies are transforming machine learning so it is not like machine learning of the past.

The evolution of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. (Image source: Tandon 2016)

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data. (Marr 2018). Deep learning combines advances in computing power and special types of neural networks to learn complicated patterns in large amounts of data (SAS 2019).

Neural networks are computing systems with interconnected nodes (illustrated by red and blue input and output points below) that work much like neurons in the human brain (SAS 2019). A Neural network is made up of a number of interconnected nodes and hidden layers. A hidden layer is any layer between the input layer and output layer and there can be multiple hidden layers (Zhou 2019). Using algorithms, neural networks can recognise hidden patterns and correlations in raw data, cluster and classify it, and, over time, continuously learn and improve. (SAS 2019)

These are being used for virtual assistants like Alexa or Siri or Cortana, translations, autonomous cars, chatbots, facial recognition, personalised marketing and medical diagnosis, the list goes on (Marr 2019). Amazon used deep learning to train its software to analyse medical records. And according to Taha Kass-Hout, the software performed as well as or better than similar programs. It was also able to pull out data regarding patients' illnesses, prescriptions, lab orders and procedures, all of which is organized into a spreadsheet-like report. (Locklear - Engadget 2018). This work is currently done by around 60 people, so this advance has the potential to replace them in pulling data from approximately 500,000 patient records.

The potential applications seem limitless as deep learning algorithms continue to perform better as they gain more experience, however, it is good to keep in mind that ethical principles should be followed when developing and using them. These should include ensuring benefits are greater than costs, they cause no harm or disadvantage, they’re legal, protect privacy, transparent, contestable and creators are accountable for impacts of algorithms.

### Natural language processing 

Natural language refers to the way we, communicate with each other through speech and text. (Brownlee 2017). While the processing of natural language, Natural Language Processing (NLP), is not a new science, the technology is rapidly advancing thanks to an increased interest in human-to-machine communications, plus an availability of big data, powerful computing and enhanced algorithms. (SAS 2019)
Moore, an AI and Language Analytics Strategist, SAS describes Natural language processing as:
> … a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. In general terms, NLP tasks break down language into shorter, elemental pieces, and tries to understand relationships among those pieces to explore how they work together to create meaning. The combination of NLP, machine learning and human subject matter expertise holds the potential to revolutionize how we approach new and existing problems (Moore 2019). 

Given the volume and importance of this type of data, we must have ways to understand and harness the value of natural language, as we do for other types of data. (Brownlee 2019). 

But Natural Language Processing is difficult because of the: 

-	complexity of representing, learning, and using
-	ambiguity in meaning 
-	interpretation needs real world experience, common sense, and contextual knowledge. (Shahriari 2019) 

As the example below illustrates, depending on how the language is broken down into smaller pieces can dramatically affect the processing of its meaning:
